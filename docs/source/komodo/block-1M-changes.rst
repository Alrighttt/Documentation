Block Height 1000000 Changes
****************************

When Komodo reaches block height 1000000, two notable changes will happen. Block 1000000 is expected to happen in the first half of September 2018. 

Rewards
=======

Currently, the rewards mechanism will cap the amount of accrued rewards after 1 year. For example, if coins sit in the same wallet for more than a full year, the amount of rewards will stop accruing at 5% total. This mechasism is being changed to cap the amount of accrued rewards after 1 month. This means in order to receive the full amount of rewards, a user must claim them at least once per month. This in turn, changes the amount of rewards to 5.1%/year. 


Mining Free for All
===================

Currently, every 2000 blocks, there is a 64 block period in which notary nodes are unable to mine with easy difficulty. After block 1000000, this 64 block period will be removed. This change does not effect the profitability of a POW miner. This is being changed to prevent miners from only mining during these 64 block periods.
